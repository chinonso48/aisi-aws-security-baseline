# AISI AWS Security Baseline - Submission Report

**Candidate**: Daniel  
**Position**: Principal Platform/Product Security Engineer  
**Date**: September 2025  
**Challenge**: Securing a New AWS Account  

## Executive Summary

This submission delivers a comprehensive, production-ready AWS security baseline that establishes day-one security posture for high-risk AISI platforms. The solution implements all core requirements plus advanced stretch goals, providing automated security controls, compliance monitoring, and exception management within a cost-optimized framework.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Multi-Account Security Strategy
**Decision**: Implemented true cross-account architecture with dedicated Security and Logging accounts.  
**Rationale**: Separates security concerns, prevents local tampering of audit logs, and enables centralized compliance monitoring across AISI's organization.  
**Implementation**: KMS keys with cross-account policies, S3 bucket policies for log delivery, and Config aggregation in Security account.

### 2. Defense-in-Depth Approach
**Decision**: Combined preventive (SCPs), detective (Config/GuardDuty), and corrective (auto-remediation) controls.  
**Rationale**: Single control failures won't compromise security posture. SCPs provide unbypassable guardrails while Config enables continuous monitoring.  
**Implementation**: 5-layer security model with automatic fallback to temporary exceptions when remediation fails.

### 3. Intelligent Exception Management
**Decision**: Built sophisticated exception handling with expiry dates and automated cleanup.  
**Rationale**: Real-world platforms need flexibility for legitimate edge cases while maintaining security oversight.  
**Implementation**: DynamoDB-backed exception tracking with EventBridge automation and SNS notifications.

### 4. Cost-Conscious Design
**Decision**: Focused on managed services with optimized retention periods and selective monitoring.  
**Rationale**: Security shouldn't create prohibitive costs. Balanced comprehensive coverage with operational efficiency.  
**Result**: £39-189/month per account depending on usage, with clear cost optimization guidance.

## Critical Assumptions Made

### Infrastructure Assumptions
- **AWS Organizations**: Functional multi-account organization with established Security/Logging OUs
- **Network Connectivity**: VPC peering or Transit Gateway for cross-account access where needed
- **Existing Buckets**: Central CloudTrail and Config S3 buckets pre-configured with appropriate policies
- **Break-Glass Access**: Designated emergency user or role for SCP exceptions

### Operational Assumptions
- **Team Maturity**: Platform teams have basic Terraform/AWS knowledge and CI/CD pipelines
- **Change Management**: Formal process exists for security baseline updates and exception approvals
- **Monitoring Integration**: Existing SIEM/monitoring tools can consume SNS notifications and CloudWatch metrics
- **Compliance Requirements**: UK government security standards (likely Cyber Essentials Plus/ISO 27001)

## Technical Trade-offs and Limitations

### Trade-offs Made
1. **Config vs. CloudFormation Drift Detection**: Chose Config for broader resource coverage despite higher cost
2. **Custom KMS Keys vs. AWS Managed**: Custom keys for better access control and audit trails despite complexity
3. **Real-time vs. Batch Remediation**: EventBridge real-time processing for faster security response
4. **Comprehensive Logging vs. Cost**: Enabled all GuardDuty features and VPC Flow Logs for complete visibility

### Known Limitations
- **SCP Testing**: Requires AWS Organizations access for full validation (provided mock tests instead)
- **Lambda Package Size**: Exception manager could exceed 50MB with complex dependencies in production
- **Regional Failover**: CloudTrail regional failover requires additional automation not implemented
- **Custom Config Rules**: Framework provided but specific AISI requirements would need additional rules

## Production Extension Roadmap

### Phase 1: Enhanced Monitoring (Month 1-2)
- **Security Hub Integration**: Centralize findings from GuardDuty, Config, and custom detectors
- **SIEM Integration**: Forward security events to AISI's central SIEM platform
- **Advanced Dashboards**: CloudWatch/Grafana dashboards for security metrics and KPIs
- **Automated Reporting**: Scheduled compliance reports for audit and management review

### Phase 2: Advanced Automation (Month 3-4)
- **Custom Config Rules**: AISI-specific compliance rules for ML workloads and research data
- **Advanced Remediation**: Expand auto-remediation beyond tagging (security group fixes, etc.)
- **Threat Hunting**: Custom GuardDuty rules and threat intelligence integration
- **Supply Chain Security**: Implement SLSA attestation and signed container images

### Phase 3: AI/ML Security Features (Month 5-6)
- **Model Weight Protection**: Dedicated KMS keys and access patterns for ML models
- **GPU Security**: Container runtime security and tenant isolation for GPU workloads
- **Data Lineage**: Track sensitive data movement through ML pipelines
- **Prompt Injection Protection**: Implement content filtering and input sanitization

### Phase 4: Zero Trust Architecture (Month 7-12)
- **Identity-Centric Security**: Implement fine-grained ABAC with IAM Identity Center
- **Network Microsegmentation**: VPC security groups based on resource tags and identity
- **Continuous Verification**: Real-time risk assessment and adaptive access controls
- **Secrets Automation**: Dynamic secrets with HashiCorp Vault integration

## Cost Optimization Strategy

### Immediate Optimizations
- **Log Retention Tuning**: 90-day default with lifecycle transitions to IA/Glacier
- **Config Selective Recording**: Focus on security-relevant resources only
- **Regional Consolidation**: Concentrate high-cost services in primary regions

### Long-term Cost Management
- **Reserved Instance Strategy**: RI purchases for predictable GuardDuty/Config usage
- **Data Lake Architecture**: Transition to cost-effective analytics with Athena/Glue
- **Automated Scaling**: Lambda-based cost monitoring with automatic optimization suggestions

## Risk Mitigation Summary

This baseline addresses critical security risks while maintaining operational efficiency:

- **✅ Data Breaches**: Comprehensive encryption and access logging prevent unauthorized data access
- **✅ Compliance Violations**: Continuous monitoring and automated remediation ensure regulatory compliance  
- **✅ Insider Threats**: Cross-account logging and immutable audit trails provide accountability
- **✅ Configuration Drift**: SCPs and Config rules prevent and detect security misconfigurations
- **✅ Cost Overruns**: Built-in cost controls and optimization guidance prevent budget surprises

The solution provides AISI with enterprise-grade security suitable for high-risk AI research platforms while maintaining developer productivity and cost efficiency. The modular, extensible design ensures the baseline can evolve with AISI's growing security requirements and advancing threat landscape.
